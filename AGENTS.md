# AGENTS.md — orienting guide for AI coding agents (and humans in a hurry)

This file is the **canonical entry point** for working in this repo. Read it
first; it is written to be ingested in one shot. Deeper references live in
[`docs/`](docs/). Everything here is kept honest by tests. If a fact below is
wrong, that's a bug.

## What this is — the data is the product

`gazetteer` is a Go library that, given a French address, brings back **rich,
typed, well-extracted data across every dimension that matters when an investor
evaluates a property** — price, rents, rental demand, tenant solvency, taxes,
safety, transport, hazards, building quality, the social/regulatory context, and
more. Each dimension comes from a dedicated `Source` as a **fully-typed `Result`
with documented, unit-bearing fields**. That typed data *is* the point.

An optional, thin convenience layer sits on top — `appraisal.*` consolidates a
few dimensions (price/rent/hazard) and `appraisal/zonescore` composites them
into a 0–100 score. Treat it as a sample high-level API, not the goal: most
callers want the underlying Results, not the score.

A CLI (`cmd/gazetteer`) is the fastest way to explore the data.

## 30-second mental model

```
Listing (address + property attrs)
   │  client.Normalize()  → fills INSEE, Lat/Lon, IRIS from free text
   ▼
Sources run in parallel (each independent, offline or live HTTP)
   ▼
Dossier  = map[name]Result   ← THE PRODUCT: one typed Result per dimension
   ▼ (optional convenience layer)
appraisal.PricePerM2 / RentValue / HazardProfile  ·  zonescore.Compute → score
```

```go
client, _ := factory.NewDefault(ctx)               // wires every stable source
listing, _ := client.Normalize(ctx, "12 rue X, 93100 Montreuil")
dossier := client.Collect(ctx, listing)            // runs all sources in parallel

// Pull the typed data you care about — this is the main use of the lib:
if r, ok := gazetteer.Get[*dvf.Result](dossier, dvf.Name); ok && !r.IsEmpty() {
    // r is *dvf.Result; every field is documented with its unit (see godoc)
}

// Optional: the convenience synthesis layer on top.
score := zonescore.Compute(dossier)
```

## The data is the point — discovering Result types + field meanings

Most of your work here is "which source gives dimension X, and what does each
field mean (units!)". The answers, easiest first:

1. **`gazetteer sources catalog --json`** (or `docs/sources.json`) — every
   source's summary, required inputs, coverage, the dimension it covers, and its
   `result_schema` (field names). Start here to pick a source. Browsing by
   intent ("which source gives rental-demand data?") →
   **`gazetteer sources dimensions`** groups them by investor-evaluation
   dimension (price, rents, demand, solvency, taxes, transport, hazards, …).
2. **`go doc github.com/bpineau/gazetteer/sources/<name> Result`** — the
   authoritative field-by-field meaning **with units**. Every `Result` field
   carries a godoc comment (e.g. DVF prices are `…Cents` integers, OLL rent is
   `€/m²/month`, shares are `%`). This is the canonical data dictionary.
3. **`gazetteer sources doc <name>`** — the Result's JSON shape (field names +
   zero values) for a quick wire-format glance.
4. [docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md) — prose: what each source provides and the
   key Result fields.

Convention you can rely on: **units live in the field name or its godoc** — cents
vs euros, €/m² vs €/m²/month, % , metres, counts. When in doubt, read the field's
godoc; never guess a unit.

## The uniform Source contract — learn one, know all

**Every** package under `sources/<name>/` has the *same* shape. Once you've used
one source you've used all of them:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `const Name` | the registry key, e.g. `dvf.Name == "dvf"` |
| `const Version` | bumps when logic changes |
| `type Options struct{ …; DataDir string }` | config; zero value is usually valid |
| `func NewSource(Options) *Source` | constructor |
| `func Query(ctx, Options, Listing) (*Result, error)` | **atomic helper** — run one source without the builder |
| `type Result struct{ …; Evidence Evidence }` | the typed payload; `Evidence` is a `json:"-"` provenance sidecar |
| `func (*Result) IsEmpty() bool` | true ⇒ "ran fine, no data for this address" |

Pull a source's result out of a Dossier with the generic accessor:

```go
r, ok := gazetteer.Get[*filoiris.Result](dossier, filoiris.Name)
```

## Fastest way to explore — the CLI is self-describing

```bash
gazetteer sources catalog --json   # ← START HERE: every source's inputs,
                                    #   coverage, returns and which axis it feeds
gazetteer sources list             # names + versions (+ opt-in marker)
gazetteer sources doc <name>       # the Result's JSON shape (reflected)
gazetteer query    --json <addr>   # run every source on a real address
gazetteer appraise        <addr>   # query + price/rent/hazard + zone score
gazetteer compare  <a> <b> …       # rank addresses; --profile yield|transport|…
```

`docs/sources.json` is the same catalog committed to the repo (read it without
running anything).

## Inputs cheat-sheet — what each `Listing` field unlocks

`Normalize()` fills INSEE, Lat/Lon and IRIS from free text. If a source returns
empty, the usual cause is a **missing input** or **out-of-coverage** address.

| Listing field | Unlocks |
|---|---|
| `INSEE` (5-digit) | most commune-level sources (filosofi, taxefonciere, delinquance, …) |
| `Lat` / `Lon` | spatial sources: cadastre, cdsr, gpe, nuisances, osm_transit, georisques |
| `IRIS` (9-digit) | `filoiris`, `logiris` — **Île-de-France only**; set by the `iris` source / normalizer |
| `SurfaceM2` | DVF €-total, taxe-foncière estimate |
| `Rooms` | carteloyers, oll, encadrement (typology bucket) |
| `PropertyType` | DVF + encadrement eligibility (default `apartment`) |

## Reading results — the empty/error model (read before debugging)

| Outcome | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `Status==OK`, `IsEmpty()==false` | real data | use it |
| `Status==OKEmpty` / `IsEmpty()==true` | source ran, **no data for this address** — NOT an error | check the source's required input + coverage in the catalog |
| `Status==Failed*` + `Result.Err != nil` | real failure (transient / permanent / antibot) | inspect `Err`; transient = retryable |
| `errors.Is(err, gazetteer.ErrInsufficientInputs)` | you didn't supply a required input | see the cheat-sheet above |
| `errors.Is(err, gazetteer.ErrSourceCircuitTripped)` | upstream tripped a breaker this run | transient; fresh run resets |

## Debugging recipes

- **"a mostly-empty Dossier — why?"** → `gazetteer query --explain "<addr>"`.
  It prints the normalised Listing and, per source that returned nothing, the
  cause: a **missing required input** ("Listing is missing X, which this source
  needs") vs **no data for this address** ("inputs present → coverage: …"). This
  is the first move for any "I got nothing back" question.
- **"source X returned empty"** → `--explain` answers it; for the raw logs run
  `gazetteer query --verbose --source X "<addr>"`.
- **"the number looks wrong"** → every Result has an `Evidence` sidecar with
  provenance (which tier/zone/dataset year it used). Inspect it.
- **"it's slow"** → only the *live-HTTP* sources cost latency (dvf, georisques,
  education, ademe, cadastre). Offline sources are instant. DVF is the usual
  culprit; it's already optimised (section prefilter + `dvf.HostRateLimits()`).

## Optional convenience layer (appraisal + zonescore)

Sits on top of the Dossier; **skip it if you just want the data**. A sample
high-level API, not the project's purpose.

- `appraisal.PricePerM2`, `RentValue`, `HazardProfile` consolidate a few
  dimensions across sources (a source opts in by implementing
  `appraisal.PriceEstimator` / `RentEstimator` / `HazardReporter`).
- `appraisal/zonescore.Compute(dossier, opts…)` → a 0–100 score over 6 axes
  (rendement, tension, solvabilité, sécurité, fiscalité, accès);
  `zonescore.Compare(...)` ranks several addresses; weight presets via
  `zonescore.Personas` / the CLI `--profile`. The catalog's `feeds` field says
  which source drives which axis.

## Batch & subset access — beyond one-address-at-a-time

Two patterns sit alongside the per-address `Collect`:

- **Run fewer Sources.** `factory.Options.Exclude` is a deny-list applied to
  the full default roster (e.g. `Exclude: []string{"bdnb"}` drops the live BDNB
  API); `Builder.Without(names…)` prunes a pre-populated Builder before
  `.Build()`; `Client.CollectSome(ctx, listing, names…)` collects only a named
  subset on an existing Client (cheap embedded Sources first, before slow live
  APIs). Sources run independently, so dropping an unconsumed one never affects
  the others.
- **Screen every commune offline.** `overview.Build(overview.Options{Depts…})`
  joins the embedded, commune-keyed Sources into one `CommuneOverview` row per
  commune (price, market rent, encadrement cap, income, vacancy, taxe foncière,
  QPV, zonage, transit lines) with **no network I/O** — the inverse of the
  per-address Dossier. It rides on per-Source **batch-read helpers** that skip
  the `Listing`/`Query` path: `dvfagg.Load(dir).Codes()` / `.Lookup(insee)`,
  `qpv.Load(dir).HasQPV(insee)`, `delinquance.Load(dir).Level(insee)`,
  `communes.Default().All()` — reach for these whenever you need many communes
  at once instead of one address.

## Adding a new Source (checklist)

Copy a model: `sources/filoiris` (clean dataset-backed source) or `sources/gpe`
(spatial). Then:

1. `result.go` — `Result` + `IsEmpty()` + `Evidence`, with a package godoc.
2. `source.go` — `Name`/`Version`/`Options`/`Query`, and `init()` calls
   `gazetteer.Register(Name, func() any { return &Result{} })`.
3. `loader.go` + `transform.go` — only if it ships an embedded dataset
   (see [docs/datasets.md](docs/datasets.md); bootstrap via
   `gazetteer refresh --go-embed-update <name>`).
4. Wire it: `factory/factory.go`, `cmd/gazetteer/sources_registry.go`, a
   renderer in `cmd/gazetteer/render.go`, and a **catalog descriptor** in
   `cmd/gazetteer/catalog.go`.
5. Tests + docs (`docs/sources.md`, README, godoc — this is the Definition of
   Done, not a follow-up).

The catalog **completeness test** fails until every registered source has a
descriptor, so the machine-readable catalog can never silently drift.
See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) for out-of-tree plugins.

## Local quality gate (run once)

```bash
make hooks   # installs .githooks: pre-commit runs `make precommit`
```

`make precommit` = `fmt-check vet lint test tidy-check` — the whole gate, fast
(~seconds with Go's cache), so trivial bugs (bad format, vet/lint, broken build
or test, untidy go.mod) are caught **before** the commit lands instead of in CI.
Need the linters first: `make tools`. Bypass a WIP checkpoint with
`git commit --no-verify`. The hook chains to any global hooks path first, so it
never disables corporate secret-scanning.

## Invariants & footguns

- `zonescore.Options.Weights` **replaces** the default weight set wholesale — a
  partial map means "score only these axes", not "tweak a few".
- `gazetteer refresh` is **idempotent** (a current dataset is skipped); safe on boot.
- IRIS coverage is **Île-de-France only in practice**: the `iris` resolver and
  `logiris` are IDF-scoped datasets. `filoiris`'s dataset is *national*, but it
  only fires where `Listing.IRIS` is set — and `iris` (IDF-only) is the sole
  resolver that sets it, so non-IDF addresses get no IRIS and thus no `filoiris`.
- `oll` **excludes Paris intra-muros** (use `encadrement` for Paris rents).
- `gpe` (future Grand Paris Express stations) is **informational, not scored** —
  future transit must not distort the yield-first-today score.
- Datasets ship **embedded in the binary**; the datadir (`~/.cache/gazetteer`)
  is an *optional* override populated by `refresh`, never required.
- **Gate a Result on `IsEmpty()`, never on `field != 0`.** Many numeric Result
  fields are plain values where `0` is a *legitimate* reading (e.g. `rpls` 0 %
  social housing — ~64 % of communes; a count of 0) — distinct from "no data".
  `IsEmpty()` (⇒ `StatusOKEmpty`) is the only correct "did this source find
  anything" test; comparing a field to zero silently drops real zeros.
- **Rent basis — CC vs HC.** `carteloyers` rents are *charges comprises* (CC,
  field suffix `…CC`); `oll` and `encadrement` are *hors charges* (HC, `…HC`).
  Don't compare the raw fields across sources — different bases. Use
  `appraisal.RentValue`, which converts CC→HC (≈0.90) before blending.
- `taxefonciere.EstimatedEURPerYear` is an **order-of-magnitude estimate, not
  the exact bill** — a valeur-locative proxy understates high-value communes
  (Paris ≈ ½ the real figure). Compare communes with it; don't quote it as the sum due.
- `CollectSome` / `Builder.Without` / `factory.Options.Exclude` **ignore unknown
  Source names** (a typo'd name silently runs/keeps nothing) — they now log a
  warning, so watch the logs when a subset comes back unexpectedly empty.
